This is a project made following a tutorial from FreeCodeCamp. I added two extra funcionalities, 
home page link and ability to exit modal component by clicking on the side. This was a good project to get familiar
with the syntaxes and workflow. I haven't implemented the router component so I guess there won't be
option to go to live page through GitHub, but I'll link it here. In the future I will try to
fix this.

In this project I used custom and original hooks, and big attention was placed on implementing
them on the components and making them work. There is also an API for the meals and this is 
something I never encountered before, so it was cool seeing how APIs' are used.
Also, you can search meal by the name, and if there is none, the message shows up
that says no meals found.
The hardest thing was figuring out how to implement home page button because I had to find the way on my own,
but once I did it it was obvious that it was not that hard.

During the work, even though I followed a tutorial, there were all sorts of error messages.
I guess that is a good thing since that makes you figure out what is wrong and also finding bugs.

Last time I did a project with tutorial, the next one was fully independent (ToDoApp), so I guess it would
be the best to countinue with this tradition, just to see I have learned.
